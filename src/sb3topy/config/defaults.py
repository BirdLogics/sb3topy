"""
config.py

Contains default configuration settings. All of the values in this file
should be considered modifiable through user configuration.

Do not modify the values of this module at runtime.
    eg. config.defaults.AUTORUN = True
Instead, modify the values imported from this module into config.
    eg. config.AUTORUN = True

General Settings:
    OUTPUT_PATH: The default folder in which to save the converted
        project, download/extracted assets, and converted assets.

    PROJECT_PATH: The path to a project sb3 file to extract and convert

    PROJECT_URL: The path to a project to download and convert

    CONFIG_PATH: The config path specified by the command line -c
        argument.

    AUTOLOAD_CONFIG: Whether the config file should be autoloaded by
        the GUI if the default CONFIG_PATH points to it.

    USE_GUI: Whether the GUI should be run rather than running the
        converter directly.

    AUTORUN: Automatically run the project after the conversion has
        completed.
    TODO Disable autorun if there were warnings/errors

    PARSE_PROJECT: Whether to parse the project. Normally True.

    COPY_ENGINE: Whether to attempt to copy engine files. Normally
        True. To avoid overwritting modified engine files, use
        OVERWRITE_ENGINE instead.

    JSON_SHA: The expected SHA256 of a downloaded project.json. If
        the hash doesn't match when the json is downloaded, the
        conversion process will be aborted. Used as a safety measure to
        prevent a vulnerability from being exploited in one of the
        example projects. Not checked for extracted projects.

    IS_COMPILED: Whether to replace <is compiled?> procedure arguments
        with True, to emulate TurboWarp's behavior.

Asset Settings:
    FRESHEN_ASSETS: Overwrite existing assets when downloading or
        extracting the project rather than skipping them.
    VERIFY_ASSETS: Validate downloaded or extracted assets before
        saving them.

    CONVERT_SOUNDS: Allows disabling of mp3 conversion. When using
        Pygame 2+, mp3 conversion is not required, but it is still
        recommended.
    CONVERT_COSTUMES: Allows disabling of svg conversion. All svgs
        must be converted for the project to run.
    CONVERT_ASSETS: Allows disabling of asset conversion. The project
        will not be able to run if any svgs are in the project.

    RECONVERT_SOUNDS: Convert and overwrite previously converted
        sounds. Useful if sounds were corrupted during conversion.
    RECONVERT_IMAGES: Convert and overwrite previously converted
        images. Useful if images were corrupted during conversion.

    CONVERT_THREADS: The number of threads to use when converting
        assets. Note that each thread usually creates a process.
    TODO Default CONVERT_THREADS to cpu_count?

    CONVERT_TIMEOUT: The amount of time to allow an asset to convert.
        Useful to diagnose hanging during asset conversion.

    USE_CAIROSVG: Enables use of the cairosvg Python package. Using the
        cairosvg package is much faster than calling a command.
    SVG_COMMAND: The command used to convert an svg file to a png file.
        The input and output path will be passed through {INPUT} and
        {OUTPUT} format parameters. {DPI} or {SCALE} should also be
        used to allow adjustable bitmap resolution.

    BASE_DPI: The DPI of an unscaled SVG image.

    SVG_SCALE: How much to scale SVGs when converting to bitmap.

    MP3_COMMAND: The command used to convert an mp3 file to a wav file.
        The input and output path will be passed through {INPUT} and
        {OUTPUT} format parameters.

Optimizations Settings:
    LEGACY_LISTS: Use list classes wth maximum compatibility for legacy
        indices (first, last, random, all). Only necessary if a block
        containing a legacy index is used instead of directly putting
        first/last/random/all in the list block.

    VAR_TYPES: Enables variable type guessing. Disabling may improve
        compatibility as type guessing is still a work in progress.

    ARG_TYPES: Enables type guessing for custom block arguments. As
        with VAR_TYPES, disabling may improve compatibility.

    LIST_TYPES: Enables lists to be detected a Static, or unchanging.
    TODO LIST_TYPES is a bad name

    SOLO_BROADCASTS: Treats broadcasts with only a single receiver in
        sprites which aren't cloned sort of like cross sprite custom
        blocks. May cause issues with projects which use a block in the
        create clone of block.

    DISABLE_ANY_CAST: Causes the type guesser to ignore items with the
        'any' type when guessing the type of an object. If the object
        is set to a item of any type, the item will be casted to the
        guessed type of the object.

    AGGRESSIVE_NUM_CAST: If an object is ever set to a number, assume
        the object is of a numeric type.

    CHANGED_NUM_CAST: If a variable is ever changed using the
        "data_changevariableby" block, assume the variable is of a
        numeric type. NOTE: This is NOT disabled by VAR_TYPES.

    DISABLE_STR_CAST: If an object is set to both a string and a
        number assume the object is of the any type rather than the str
        type. Assuming the object is any prevents a primarily numeric
        object from frequently casting a number to a string, and then
        back to a number again when the object is used.
    TODO Used as type detection?

    DISABLE_INT_CAST: Due to flaws in type detection, float objects can
        sometimes be incorrectly detected as integer objects.
    TODO Use block return types in type detection

    SIG_DIGITS: Floating point values lose accuracy when they get too
        long. Only values which have fewer characters than SIG_DIGITS
        after the decimal point (or the entire value for ints) will be
        detected a number. Other values are assumed to be strings.

    WARP_ALL: Enables warp on every custom block. May improve
        performance with certain projects, but will cause major issues
        with other projects.

Download Settings:
    PROJECT_HOST: The path to the projects website.

    ASSET_HOST: The path to the assets website.

    DOWNLOAD_THREADS: The number of threads to use when downloading
        project assets.

DEBUG_SETTINGS:
    LOG_LEVEL: The log level to set when initializing the logger.

    DEBUG_JSON: Saves a copy of the project.json when converting the
        project. Adds a small amount of time to the conversion
        process.

    FORMAT_JSON: Adds indentation to the saved debug json. Adds even
        more time to the conversion process.

    OVERWRITE_ENGINE: Deletes the engine folder from the output
        directory before copying files. Otherwise, if the engine folder
        exists, the engine will not be copied, even if it has been
        modified.

    DEFAULT_GUI_TAB: The default tab to switch to in the GUI. It can be
        useful to automatically switch to examples when testing. May be
        'convert', 'examples', 'output', or 'settings'

    TARGET_CLUSTERS: Whether to group nodes belonging to each target
        when rendering the type graph

    PROC_CLUSTERS: Whether to group nodes belonging to a procedure when
        rendering the type graph
